## Gradient Descent Visualization

**Visualizing Stochastic Gradient Descent on the run**

The following repository was built to create a simple widget-app embedded within a Jupyter Notebook that enables a more intuitive understanding and exploration of how stochastic gradient descent iteratively updates the classification boundary (hyperplane).

Developed by [Ankit Tharwani](https://github.com/ankittharwani) and [Guillermo (Will) Monge](https://github.com/WillahScott).
